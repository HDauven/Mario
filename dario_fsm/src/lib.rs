//! # Dario FSM lib
//!
//! The `dario_fsm` library demonstrates how a simple Finite-State Machine (FSM) implementation works, in this case specifically for managing the various states Dario can be in.
//! It allows for the simulation of Dario's state based on a given game event, like collecting a power-up or taking damage.
//!
//!  The library revolves around two enums: `DarioState`, representing Dario's possible states, and
//! `Event`, representing different events that can trigger state changes. The core functionality is encapsulated
//! in the `transition` function, which computes the new state of Dario based on the current state and an event.

/// Represents the various states that Dario can be in.

/// # Examples

/// ```
/// use dario_fsm::DarioState;
///
/// let state = DarioState::Regular;
/// println!("{:?}", state); // Output: Regular
/// ```
#[repr(u32)]
